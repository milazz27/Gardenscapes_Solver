Outline of Project Elements:

1. Grid Representation:
    Piece Types:
        +  Leaf     -> Obstacle
        +  Flower   -> Obstacle
        +  Apple    -> Obstacle
        +  Berry    -> Obstacle
        +  Lemonade
    
    Cells On Grid:
        +  Contain an Obstacle
        +  Contain the Lemonade
        +  Empty
        +  Full --> Obstacle or Lemonade

    Location Utilities (Maybe set up to take in row/column or x/y):
        +  Is at bottom
        +  Has something above
        +  Has something below
        +  Has something to the left
        +  Has something to the right
    
    Maybe Some Additional Utilities to Help with Matching:
        +  Has same type as cell to the left
        +  Has same type as cell to the right
        +  Has same type as cell above
        +  Has same type as cell below
        +  Number of same types touching at all sides (Up, Down, Left, Right)

    Grid Representation:
        +  Simple Version: 2D Grid
    
2. Grid Access
    Access Methods:
        +  Get Cell Content
        +  Set Cell Content
        +  Check if Cell is Full
        +  Check if Cell is Empty
        +  Swap Cells

3. Pattern Detection
    Functions to Include:
        +  Scan the entire grid for matches
        +  Identify patterns of obstacles
            - 3 in a row - Horizontal
            - 3 in a row - Vertical
            - 4 in a row - Horizontal
            - 4 in a row - Vertical
            - 5 in a row - Horizontal
            - 5 in a row - Vertical
            - (Maybe Later):
                * L-shape
                * T-shape
        +   Check if move generates a pattern
            +   Should be set up to accept two cell positions as input

4. Reset Grid
    Functionality to Include:
        +  Obstacles drop down to fill empty spaces
        +  Empty cells pad at the top if nothing else there

5. Moves
    Things to Include:
        +  Rules for Valid Moves
            -  bounds of the grid
            -  swapping only adjacent cells
            -  allowed to swap:
                * Obstacle with Obstacle
                * Obstacle with Lemonade
                * Objectacle with Empty
            -  not allowed to swap:
                * Empty with Empty
                * Lemonade with Lemonade
            -  Valid moves must result in at least one pattern being formed
        +  Adjusting the Grid After a Move
            -  swap the two cells
            -  check for patterns
            -  if patterns found, reset the grid
            -  if no patterns found, swap back
        +  Transitioning Grid:
            -  Execute the reset grid actions in order

6. Goal Cond
    Things to Include:
        +   Scan the grid to see if all lemonade is at the bottom

7. Plan Algorithm
