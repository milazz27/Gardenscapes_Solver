DONE !> reimplement swappability functions for rdefined way of
    representing the things

> define goal state and add parameter to source files that tell you how many objects

> add some documentation. Explicit about logical structure of
    > discuss the general structure of how prolog functions 
    operations and defs:
        - cell types
        - adjacency 
        - matching rules
        - swappability
            + pieces can be swapped unless they are the following:
                1. pieces cannot both be empty
                2. pieces cannot both be objects
            + Additionally, pieces must be adjacent to swap them


> look more into A* algorithm 

> make the print format better (buffer cell print), add guide marks for screen shots

> make some more example boards

> structure make files for execution

> add layer to program where nodes with highest adjacency score after swap (4)
