##Intro to Logic-Based AI Final Project (Fall 2025)

![Current Progress](..\docs\checkpoint1.gif)

This project will be aimed at building an AI Agent to solve (my favorite mobile game) 'Gardenscapes.' To do this I will employ a planning approach in Prolog. 

To be specific, I will be abstacting levels of the game where the goal is to match blocks to clear the way for objects at the top of the grid to reach the 'ground.'
